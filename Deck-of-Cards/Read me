#Deck of Cards

Create a deck of cards using C#. I chose to use an array for this particular question. This was made as part of a technical test that I undertook for a company on the 14th of Aug, 2019.

I was asked to create a virtual deck of cards, and consider how I would create the cards, shuffle the cards, how the cards would look in the players hand, and how I would identify the type of card.

My logic:

    deck of cards has 52 cards
    13 faces(deuce, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king) of each suit
    4 suits (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs)

Features Implemented:

    Create and intitalize deck
    Shuffle deck
    3 Print functions: - current position of cards - face, suit, etc - players hand
    Function to identify cards
    Deal cards
    players hand

Future updates that havent been taken into consideration here:

    Eliminate duplicate cards
    Additional card drawing
    Unique 52 cards so there are no duplicates, and only 52 cards can be played
    Shuffle deck excludes cards in your hand
